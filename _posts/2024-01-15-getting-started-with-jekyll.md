# Getting Started with Jekyll

Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator that makes it easy to create beautiful websites. In this post, I'll share my experience setting up my personal landing page with Jekyll.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages for personal websites:

- **Simple**: Write in Markdown, Jekyll handles the rest
- **Fast**: Static sites load quickly
- **Secure**: No server-side code to worry about
- **Free hosting**: Works great with GitHub Pages

## Setting Up Your First Site

The setup process is straightforward:

1. Install Jekyll and dependencies
2. Create a new Jekyll site
3. Choose a theme
4. Customize your content
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Key Configuration

The `_config.yml` file is where the magic happens. Here's what I focused on:

```yaml
title: Your Site Title
description: Your site description
remote_theme: b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console
```

## Next Steps

I'm excited to continue building out this site and sharing more about my journey with web development. Stay tuned for more posts about technology, learning, and personal growth.
